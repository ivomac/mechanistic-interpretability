You will be given a "Question", a "Received Answer", and an "Expected Answer".
Please classify the Received Answer strictly into one of four categories:
- CORRECT
- INCORRECT
- DOUBT
- ERROR

Some bad formatting on the received answer is tolerable.
Empty answer, refusal to answer, or admittance of not knowing the answer count as DOUBT.
ERROR is the category for when the received answer is glitchy, like
unterminated reasoning, repeating sentences, or jumbled characters.
